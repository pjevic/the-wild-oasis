To test the app, one might use the following credentials:

üìß Email: pjevic@icloud.com
üîê Password: 123456789

New users can only sign up from within the app, which aligns with its core purpose. If a new user is signed up, the email must be confirmed to log in.

# The Wild Oasis

This project is a web application built as part of the Ultimate React Course by Jonas Schmedtmann. It is the most feature-complete version of the app covered in the course so far.

Throughout the course, I seized the opportunity to enhance its functionality by introducing a new feature ‚Äì Add Booking. This feature allows users to seamlessly create bookings for cabins, enhancing the app‚Äôs usability and functionality.

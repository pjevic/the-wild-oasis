## Why Supabase?

- **Supabase** is an open-source alternative to Firebase, providing a robust backend as a service (BaaS). It simplifies backend development and offers features such as:

  - **Instant APIs**: Automatically generates RESTful APIs based on your database schema.
  - **Authentication**: Includes user authentication with multiple providers (e.g., email, Google, GitHub).
  - **Real-time updates**: Enables real-time synchronization between the client and the database.
  - **Scalable database**: Built on PostgreSQL, ensuring performance and scalability.
  - **File storage**: Provides secure file storage integrated with your backend.
  - **Ease of use**: Offers a straightforward setup and intuitive dashboard.

- Supabase is ideal for projects requiring a powerful and flexible backend with minimal configuration, making it a perfect fit for modern web applications.

## Why React Query?

- **React Query** is a powerful library for managing remote (server) state, offering many features that simplify development and enhance user experience (UX):
  - **Data caching**: Automatically stores fetched data in a cache for quick access.
  - **Built-in loading and error states**: Reduces boilerplate code by managing these states for you.
  - **Automatic re-fetching**: Keeps your data synchronized with the server.
  - **Pre-fetching**: Optimizes pagination and anticipates data needs.
  - **Simplified remote state mutations**: Makes updating server data easy and intuitive.
  - **Offline support**: Enables functionality when the user is offline.
- React Query is essential because **remote state** (data fetched from a server) is fundamentally different from **UI state** (local component data). Managing these two types of state separately and efficiently improves app performance and maintainability.
